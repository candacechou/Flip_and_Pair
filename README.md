## Flip and Pair Card Game

This is a simple card matching game implemented in JavaScript. In this game, the player need to match pairs of cards with the same symbol to earn points. The game includes basic animations and keeps track of the score and the number of attempts the player has been made.

## Gaming Rules

- Click on a card to reveal its content.
- Click on another card to find its matching pair.
- If the two revealed cards have the same symbol, you earn 10 points, and they remain face up.
